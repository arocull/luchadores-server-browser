            <p>
                Welcome to <em>Luchadores</em>, the top-down online arena battle involving cute creatures in constant conflict. Choose any character you like from an elistment of whacky combatants. Best your opponents in the sands or the snow. Dominate the arena! But most imporatly: have fun. We hope you have as much fun wrestling as we have watching it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We currently only support computers, but plan to support mobile devices in the future. Usernames are uncensored, but there is no form of chat between players. Controls are simple--WASD or Arrow Keys to move, Spacebar to jump, and Left Click to attack (this is character dependent). If you would like to play, please select a game server from the list below.
